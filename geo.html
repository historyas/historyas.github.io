<h1>Geography</h1>
<p>Maritime-  A Maritime civilization is one that uses lakes oceans and seas to their advantage.  So the food they ate, the water they drank, the ways they traveled were all because of a body of water. This was the easiest way to travel because they had lots of rocky mountains, they did not have a lot of plains or places to grow food. Another reason they are a maritime civilization is because of the farming issues the only place to grow food was near the water.</p>
The Aegean Sea, Ionian Sea, Adriatic Sea, and Mediterranean Sea make the greeks a maritime civilization because all of the seas connect.
