<h1>Athens VS. Sparta</h1>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>In Athens government every men over the age of 18 and born in Athens were considered citizen. Women and slaves were not considered citizens. Every citizen was a part of their government. Also, 500 people called the Council met every day. The 500 people were chosen randomly.  For a law to be passed it had to go through a the Assembly. The Assembly met every 10 days, 6,000 people had to be at the meeting to make the meeting happen. If people did not show up slaves would go around hitting people with red paint, this worked because men were embarrassed to show up with red paint stains on there cloths. Everyone at the meeting were able to speak. Most men in Athens were proud of their freedom. The Spartan government was different from the Athens government because Athens was a democracy and Sparta was an oligarchy. Sparta did have the Assemblies but the more important decisions came from a smaller group called the Council of Elders. There were two kings and 28 men in the Council of Elders and the men had to be at least 60 years old and born from a good family. The Council of Elders had the power to stop any law from existing. Also, the Assembly could only vote yes or no on the Council of Elders so they had little power. Source:History Alive</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>The Athenian economy was based on trading. The reason it’s  based on trading is because the land around Athens didn’t have a lot of food, so they traded to get goods such as food. The goods they mostly traded were things like honey, olive oil, silver, and painted pottery. Athenians also bought and sold goods at what they called an agora it is kind of like a a big supermarket. They could also buy things for their houses. Also most Athenians made their clothes at home, but they did have sandals and jewelry in the agora just in case. Athenians even sold slaves at the agora. Lastly, Athenians also made their own coins to make trade easier. Spartans relied on farming and conquering other people. Sparta didn’t have enough land to feed all of his people. So the Spartan’s then took the land they needed from the people around them. Since all the men in Sparta spent their time as warriors, the people depended on slaves and noncitizens to produce needed goods. The way Sparta usually got their slaves is by turning the people of the land they conquered into slaves called helots. The helots continued their life in their own village but had to give much of their food they grew to the Spartan citizens. They also made use of noncitizens called perioikoi. Perioikoi were free men that made clothes and weapons they might also be in the army. Unlike Athenians Spartans discouraged trade. The Spartans feared that they would get new ideas and it would ruin their government. Another reason Spartans didn’t trade that much is because they used iron bars as money unlike anyone else. The reason they use iron bars is because they are really hard to steal. Source-History Alive</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>Education in Athens, first from 6-7 boys were taught at home by slaves or moms. Than at the age of 6-14 boys went to school. At school books were not cheap so all boys did not have a book so then had to use their brains to memorize everything the teacher teaches you. Also, boys sometimes had to use tablets to write on because paper was not invented. There were some couches that thought sports such as wrestling and gymnastics.  At age 18 man were able to start military training. After training they had to go to a private teacher, but the bad thing about that is private teachers cost a lot of bucks. Girls in Athens were normally not taught to read or write. They usually helped mother in their homes. At the age of 15 girls usually got married. Girls did learn how to cook, clean, spin thread, and weave cloths. Girl's family who were wealthy did not get to choose their husband because her father chose for them. Girl’s families who were poor got to choose there own husband. Education in Sparta was mainly about war and getting people strong to fight. When babies were born they checked if the baby was healthy, if the baby was  unhealthy than they left it on a hillside to die. At age 7 Spartans were starting their training of fighting. Some girls eve got to fight and train in the military.Almost the same as Athens they were taught how to wrestle, box, foot racing, and gymnastics reading and writing were not considered important skills in Sparta but they still taught it to some boys. Spartans were taught to not complain about pain and to be brave. Some were not allowed to wear shoes and sometimes they were taught to steal food but not get caught. At age 20 men had to pass a difficult fitness test if the men passed it he became soldiers and fought for Sparta. Source-History Alive</p>
<h2>Women and slaves</h2>
<p> The women and slaves in Athens were not treated the same as men because the men were considered citizens but the women and slaves were not considered citizens. So that meant that they had way less rights then the men. Also, they could not vote, own property, and some couldn't even choose there own husband. Very little women had jobs but some had to sell goods and the more important women were priestesses. More than half people who were not poor owned slaves some were born in slavery and others were captured in the wars and made into slaves. Some slaves had to work ten hours a day in the silver mine. The women and slaves in Sparta had a lot more rights than the women had in Athens because they had the freedom of speech, husband, friends, and they could buy property. The women of Sparta were also expected to be strong like guys and be ready for war if needed. They also weren’t allowed to wear jewelry. The slaves in Sparta were people who they conquered in battle. Sparta treated their slaves harshly so they would not revolt. They were allowed to kill slaves if they were in war so sometimes they would start a war to kill the bad slaves. They tricked the slaves by asking them to fight and if they lived they could be set free but really they would just kill them in battle so none survived. The slaves or helots had some rights such as they could marry who ever they choose. Source-History alive</p>
