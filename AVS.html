<h1>Athens VS. Sparta</h1>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>In Athens government every men over the age of 18 and born in Athens were considered citizen. Women and slaves were not considered citizens. Every citizen was a part of their government. Also, 500 people called the Council met every day. The 500 people were chosen randomly.  For a law to be passed it had to go through a the Assembly. The Assembly met every 10 days, 6,000 people had to be at the meeting to make the meeting happen. If people did not show up slaves would go around hitting people with red paint, this worked because men were embarrassed to show up with red paint stains on there cloths. Everyone at the meeting were able to speak. Most men in Athens were proud of their freedom. The Spartan government was different from the Athens government because Athens was a democracy and Sparta was an oligarchy. Sparta did have the Assemblies but the more important decisions came from a smaller group called the Council of Elders. There were two kings and 28 men in the Council of Elders and the men had to be at least 60 years old and born from a good family. The Council of Elders had the power to stop any law from existing. Also, the Assembly could only vote yes or no on the Council of Elders so they had little power. </p>
